<h1>National Ministries Allocation Data Form for {{year}}</h1>
<p>This is an online version of the National Ministries Allocation Data Form for the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.
Please use this form to report your parish's financial information for the National Ministries Allocation Process. 

<h3>Changes This Year</h3>
There are two new lines at the end of the form for entering stewardship information.

<h3>Due Date</h3>
<p>The due date for completing this form is <strong>May 30, {{ year - 1 }}</strong>. Please bear in mind that the form must be reviewed and approved by the parish priest, president, treasurer, and the chairperson of the parish's internal audit committee by that date.

<h3>Instructions for Online Form</h3>
<p><strong>In order to enter your information into the form, please click the pencil button in the top-right corner.</strong> 
It will turn green to indicate you are editing the form. Your changes will be saved automatically as you type, 
as long as there is a working internet connection. A red error message will appear if the connection is lost or 
the data is not being saved.

<p>Please follow these steps to verify that this form is working correctly on your web browser:
<ol>
  <li>Click the pencil button to enter editing mode. It should turn green.
  <li>Type something in to one of the fields in the form below.
  <li>Refresh the page in your browser.
  <li>Verify your changes are still visible. If so, that means the form is working correctly and your changes are being saved.
</ol>

<p>If the form does not seem to be working, try using a newer web browser, such as 
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/" target="firefox">Firefox</a> or
<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="chrome">Chrome</a>. You can also
report any issues you have with the form using the 
<a target="issues" href="https://github.com/ggowan/easy-nmc/issues">issues tracker</a> 
of the GitHub repository for this form.

<p>Only one person will be able to edit the form at a time. If a second person starts editing the form, the first person
will automatically return to read-only mode.
<p>The data for {{year - 3}} has already been copied from last year's form. Please do not change these numbers.

<h3>Allocation Manual</h3>
<p>The complete reporting instructions along with background information are contained in the
<a target="manual" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n73q8puw4s5b2wl/Allocation%20Manual%202-15-2023.pdf?dl=0">National Ministries Allocation Manual</a>. For your convenience, the most essential content from the
manual has been copied into this online form, but please refer to the manual to gain a more complete understanding of the process and the purpose it serves.

<h3>General Comments</h3>
<ol>
  <li>In order to be deductible, an expense <strong>must be included</strong> in the “Total Parish
  Expenditures” on Line B of the Allocation Form. For example, if you show a
  fundraiser as a net in your “Total Parish Income” on Line A you cannot deduct the
  expenses. You would have to show the gross income on Line A and the gross
  expenses on Line B and then deduct the expenses.</li>
  <li>Forms MUST be accompanied by proper financial statements. This includes the
  balance sheets and income statements for each church account for both reported
  years. If your Financial Statements have been prepared on a GAAP basis and 
  allocated any expenses for fundraising (C5) or school (C6) deductions, you MUST provide internal financial 
  statements and cross reference your responses to those internal financial statements.</li>
  <li>Figures on financial statements must correspond to total expenses and deductions on
  the Allocation Form. If the expenses and deductions on the Allocation Form are not
  readily apparent, there should be a supplemental schedule that traces the expenses
  and deductions to the financial statements. Refer to Appendix A of the manual for an example.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Guidelines to Allocating Expenses</h3>
<p>Certain overhead expenses such as utilities, insurance, telephone, secretarial, repairs,
maintenance, and supplies, may be allocated to Fundraising, Parochial/Day School,
and Greek School only if they are:
<ol>
  <li>Approved by the local Metropolis Finance Committee</li>
  <li>Documented in the annual submission of the total commitment forms, and</li>
  <li>Comply with the guidelines below:
    <ol type="A">
      <li>The method and rationale of the allocation method must be clearly
      substantiated, documented, and quantified by the parish and approved by the
      local Metropolis Finance Committee.</li>
      <li>The documentation must include which expenses are being allocated, and
      where these expenses are posted in the parish’s income statement, and
      included in Line B – Total Expenses.</li>
      <li>The expenses must be <u>ongoing, significant and incremental</u> to the cost of the
      operations of the parish.
        <ol type="a">
          <li><b>Ongoing:</b> The costs are incurred throughout most of the year and not
          just for a few days or a week a year. Examples include extra
          insurance, shared administration staff, extra security, extra janitorial
          services, etc. Expenses related to short-term events such as
          festivals, dinner/dances, and golf outings <b><u>cannot</u></b> be allocated.
          <li><b>Significant:</b> Expenses of less than $2,500 annually per expense
          category, for example utilities, insurance, etc., <b><u>cannot</u></b> be considered
          for allocation.
          <li><b>Incremental:</b> It must be obvious that the costs in question would not
          have been incurred except for the fundraising events or school
          activities. A reasonable test to determine if an expense item can be
          allocated is to ask how much of the expense would be eliminated if
          the activity in question were to be terminated.
        </ol>
      </li>

<h4>C5. Fundraising Expenses</h4>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Funds paid exclusively to hold fundraising events and directly caused by the fundraising event such as festivals, raffles, fundraising dinners, golf tournaments etc.
  <li>Bookstore expenses are deductible (Cost of items purchased for sale, but not
    overhead.)
  <li>Note that Customary Stewardship program expenses and any funds paid to parish clergy are not deductible fundraising expenses. In addition, candle purchases are not considered a fundraising expense since candles are not “sold” to be taken home. Service attendees make a donation and light a candle as part of the worship service.
  <li>Allocated Church expenses such as utilities, security, and insurance which are
    not separately invoiced to the event are not allowable deductions. However,
    allocations of certain expenses may be allowed if they comply with the
    Guidelines to Allocating Expenses above.
  <li>When Costs associated with Church activities and ministries <strong>are recorded
    within a “fundraising activity,”</strong> such as within a parish banquet hall, these
    costs must be reasonably estimated and allocated back to the Church operations
    and included in Line B - Total Expenses. The method and rationale of the
    allocation method must be clearly substantiated, documented, quantified by the
    parish, and approved by the local Metropolis Finance Committee. Examples include a 
    single utility meter for all activities, a single insurance policy, or shared
    janitorial services.

<p>The total amount that people give to the parish that is recorded in their name as stewardship or dues, with or without a pledge card.										
<p>NOTE: This excludes candles, memorials and trays because they don't reflect ongoing, committed giving. It's the committed, regular giving that is recorded as stewardship or dues that is the main focus of this inquiry.

<h3>Common Errors</h3>
<p>Before the Allocation Form is signed and submitted, take one last look for the following common errors:
<ul>
  <li>Not including all expenses in Line B: Total Parish Expenditures. Some income statements have a supplemental P&L section for “Other Expenses” which needs to be added to the Total Expense Line B. Expenses that are reported as negative income should be converted to expenses added to Line B. All accounts and funds should be included in Line B, for example a building fund or a festival fund should be included in Line B. If you have a question about a particular situation, reach out to your Metropolis Finance Committee.
  <li>Deducting expenses that are not included in Line B. It’s very important to verify that every deduction corresponds to an expense that was included in Line B. For example, if mortgage principal payments were not included in Line B, then they cannot be deducted. Another common example would be deducting capital improvement expenses when those expenses were capitalized – in the Balance Sheet - and not included in Line B.
  <li>Deducting expenses that do not qualify for any deductible category according to the Archdiocese’s guidelines. A common case is trying to deduct a portion of undifferentiated parish operational expenses as fundraising expenses.
  <li>Misreporting transfers as expenses. A transfer of money into a savings account or between accounts is not an expense. This is an accounting error. As long as the money is still held/owned by the parish, the transfer is not an expense.
  <li>Reporting depreciation, lost income, or other kinds of write-offs as an expense in Line B. For the purpose of our allocation formula, depreciation, lost income, and other kinds of write-offs should not be included in Line B. Unfulfilled pledges are not expenses. Parishes should not be booking pledges as income and should not be reporting unfulfilled pledges as an expense.
</ul>
<p><b>Calculation errors and typos.</b> Please double check the values entered on the allocation forms to make sure there is no typo or transposition. Also, please check the sums and the additions for accuracy. 
<p><b>Looking for Consistency or Does This Make Sense?</b> Look for the following signs that something may be amiss:
<ul>
  <li>If you see a large change in net expenses (B - C) from one year to the next, this may indicate a reporting error in one year or the other (or both). Large changes in any individual line of the allocation form should also be investigated and verified.
  <li>If the reports contain just a few large line items that are summations from the financial statements, it’s very difficult to verify the deductions. A parish should provide a detailed breakdown of the large items.
</ul>
<p>If you as the preparer of the Allocation Form are just not comfortable with the instructions or are concerned that the compilation is incorrect, you should call your member of the Metropolis Allocation Committee to assist with preparation of the Allocation Form. The Metropolis Allocation Committee members are there to assist the parishes.
