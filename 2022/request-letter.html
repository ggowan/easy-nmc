    <p>Beloved {{parish_data.short_rector || "Father"}} and Esteemed Parish Council Members,

    <p>Blessed Triodion! At the instruction of His Eminence, I am sending you the below letter.

    <p>I'm pleased to announce that the Metropolis once again contributed over 100% of its
       National Ministries Allocation to the Archdiocese last year. Thank you for the contribution
       that your parish made to this important accomplishment.
        
    <p>It is now time to prepare your parish's financial report for the determination of the {{year}}
       National Ministries Allocation. This year we are continuing to use an online
       data form, which reduces errors and greatly simplifies the work of the committee responsible
       for reviewing the reports. The link to the form is below, along with the access key that
       you will need to access your parish's data form. 
      
    <p><table style="padding-left:50px">
      <tbody>
        <tr class=nontabular><td>URL:</td><td>https://easy-nmc.appspot.com/</td></tr>
        <tr class=nontabular><td>Access Key:</td><td>{{parish_data.access_key}}</td></tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>

    <p>If you have any technical difficulties accessing the form, please try using a newer web
       browser, such as Firefox or Chrome. You may also contact Geoffrey Gowan for
       assistance, or to request a paper version of the form, at geoffrey.gowan@gmail.com, or
       (510) 230-7650.
      
    <p>Once you have completed the form, please submit your parish's {{year-3}} &amp; {{year-2}} income statements
       (profit and loss) and balance sheets as indicated at the bottom of the form. Please note that 
       the deadline for submitting forms and financial statements is May 15, {{year-1}}.
      
     <p>Conveying to you His Eminence's paternal love and also my prayers for a blessed Great Lent and Pascha, I remain,

     <p>With Love in Christ,
     <br>+Bishop Apostolos
     <br>Chancellor of the Metropolis of San Francisco
